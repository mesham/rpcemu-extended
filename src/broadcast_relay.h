/*
 * broadcast_relay.h - UDP broadcast relay for Access+/ShareFS support
 *
 * Provides Access+ file sharing support over RPCEmu's NAT networking.
 * Access+ discovery uses UDP broadcasts which don't traverse NAT, so
 * this module bridges traffic between the guest's virtual network
 * (10.10.10.x) and the host's physical network.
 *
 * UDP ports handled:
 *   32770 - Discovery and share announcements (broadcast)
 *   32771 - Share management
 *   49171 - File operations
 *
 * Outgoing broadcasts are relayed to the host network; incoming
 * responses are repackaged and injected into the guest. Payloads
 * exceeding Ethernet MTU are delivered via IP fragmentation.

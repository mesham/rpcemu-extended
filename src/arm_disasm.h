 * arm_disasm.h - ARM instruction disassembler

 *   - Data processing (AND, ORR, ADD, SUB, MOV, CMP, etc.)
 *   - Multiply and multiply-accumulate
 *   - Load/store (LDR, STR, LDRH, LDRSB, etc.)
 *   - Block transfer (LDM, STM)
 *   - Branch and branch-with-link
 *   - Coprocessor instructions
 *   - Status register access (MRS, MSR)
 *   - Software interrupt (SWI)

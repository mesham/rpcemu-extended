 * GuiBridge implementation for --headless mode.

 * There is no wxWidgets window and no GUI event loop. Video reaches clients
 * through the built-in VNC server, which is fed directly from
 * rpcemu_video_update() (independently of the bridge), so the video and mouse
 * callbacks here are deliberate no-ops. Errors are reported on stderr; a fatal
 * error terminates the process (there is no dialog to show and nobody to
 * dismiss it).
